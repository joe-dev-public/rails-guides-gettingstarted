<!-- rails knows this means _form in app/views/comments
https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html#rendering-a-partial-form 

UNLIKE with the posts/_form partial, which uses a local variable, we use an
instance variable here, which I guess *kinda* goes against the guide's best-
practice recommendation that it's better to pass local variables to partials?
